I installed windows virtual studio code and also installed node.js on my pc. 
I have created two files taskControl and taskModel which contain the various task which are to be performed in this project.
taskControl contains the task name task descrpition creator duration and created at which are to be entered by the user.
I have also run a clause that if a particular task is not entered the it will display "No Task Found".
In taskModel I have entered the data types of all the required input and have calculated the duration after ehich the program will be terminated as per given by the user.
There is a function expiresAt which terminates the program after the given time duration.
